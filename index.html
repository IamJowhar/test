		<h2><u>Why this website does not look cool.</u></h2>
		<h4>I could have used <a href="http://wordpress.com">Wordpress</a> and made this site incredibly cute but I choose to keep it this way because I am <a href="http://codecademy.com">learning to program</a> and wish to update the website as I learn. <br> So this website will (hopefully) keep improving as the days pass .</h4>
